        <h1>What is DevOps?</h1>
        <p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development and IT operations teams. Its goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and deliver high-quality software reliably.</p>
        <h2>Key Principles of DevOps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Breaks down silos between development and operations teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Automates repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, and deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):</strong> Enables frequent code changes and rapid delivery to production.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring & Feedback:</strong> Uses monitoring tools to gather feedback and improve processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Shift:</strong> Encourages shared responsibility, transparency, and continuous improvement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Benefits of DevOps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster delivery of features and updates</li>
            <li>Improved collaboration and communication</li>
            <li>Higher quality and reliability of software</li>
            <li>Reduced time to recover from failures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DevOps is not just about tools or processesâ€”it's about fostering a culture where building, testing, and releasing software can happen quickly, reliably, and frequently.</p>
